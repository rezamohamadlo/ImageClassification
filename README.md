# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with ResNet50

This project implements an image classification model using the CIFAR-10 dataset and the ResNet50 architecture pretrained on ImageNet. The model extracts features from images and classifies them into one of ten categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.


The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. This project aims to build a deep learning model that can accurately classify these images using transfer learning with the ResNet50 architecture.
